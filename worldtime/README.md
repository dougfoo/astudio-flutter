## Getting Started

This project was based on a bootstrap/copy of Net Ninja's series which is a great way to get started:

Course files - https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter...
Android Studio - https://developer.android.com/studio
Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
Flutter Installation - https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/...

The one thing NetNinja doesn't go thru is how to publish to Android and IoS stores.. which isn't that hard, but would be a useful final video walkthru.
